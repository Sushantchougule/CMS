            <p><strong>Analytics on the Website and the Platform:</strong> Our website and online client platform use
                cookies and other mechanisms to collect and log analytical information, to help analyze use, to compile
                statistical reports on the use of our website, and to improve our website and marketing. To find out
                more about the use of cookies and adjust your cookie preferences, please see our cookie policy here.</p>
            <p><strong>This Privacy Policy explains the following:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Number of visitors to our website</li>
                <li>Pages visited while at the website and time spent per page</li>
                <li>Page interaction information, such as scrolling, clicks, and browsing methods</li>

            <p><strong>Cxo Database: </strong>Cxo gathers current and historic business contact data.</p>
            <p><strong>The data collected about individuals on the Digitaltechnologi Database comprises:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Employer Company & Company Details</li>
                <li>Office Location (Country & City)</li>
                <li>Business Telephone Number</li>
                <li>Business Email Address</li>
                <li>Job Title</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also hold data regarding your employer company such as its name, alias, size, industry, website, and
                industry. In some cases, we estimate individuals’ net worth based on publically available data (for
                example, the individual’s employment history or if such individual previously sold shares in a company).
                Where you have moved jobs, we may hold your previous employers and previous titles.</p>
            <p>To provide certain aspects of its services, Cxo Techhub requires a business email address to be recorded
                against profiles in its database. Where Digitaltechnologi does not have a business email address of a
                shape, it may generate a business email address based on the email address structure understood to be
                implemented by the employer company.</p>
            <p>We also hold hashed personal email addresses. Hashing is a method of encryption, whereby the email
                address itself is confuscated, and replaced with a unique reference instead, called a hash. A hash is
                one of the means used to locate the same individual on social networking. We do not reverse the hash or
                use the personal email address to contact you.</p>
            <p>The majority of the personal data we collect about you comes from publicly available sources such as
                business and employment-oriented social networks, recruitment websites, and company websites.</p>
            <p>Information is also gathered from correspondence with you (by email or phone), from our clients,
                recruiters, and other premium data providers. Digitaltechnologi does not seek to collect any
                non-business-related data such as date of birth, home address, personal email, or telephone number and
                Digitaltechnologi does not collect sensitive personal data.</p>
