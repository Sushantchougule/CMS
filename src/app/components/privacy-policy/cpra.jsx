                <h1>California Privacy Rights Act</h1>
                <p>California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) had been approved by California voters in November 2020 but was
                    not yet fully in effect. The CPRA is a significant update to the California Consumer Privacy Act
                    (CCPA) and introduces new privacy rights and requirements for businesses that process the personal
                    information of California residents. The CPRA became effective on January 1, 2023, and enforcement
                    is scheduled to begin on July 1, 2023. In this detailed explanation, we will explore the key
                    provisions and compliances of the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA).</p>

            <div className="extra">
                <h3>Expanded Consumer Rights:</h3>
                <p>The CPRA expands and enhances the consumer rights granted by the CCPA, providing Californian
                    residents with more control over their personal data. The additional rights introduced by the CPRA
                    include:</p>
                <p><strong>a. Right to Correct Personal Information: </strong>Consumers have the right to request
                    corrections of inaccurate or incomplete personal information held by businesses.</p>
                <p><strong>c. Right to Opt-out of Automated Decision-making: </strong>Consumers can opt-out of
                    businesses using their personal information to make automated decisions that have significant legal
                    or similar effects on them.</p>
                <p><strong>d. Right to Restrict Sale of Personal Information: </strong>The CPRA grants consumers the
                    right to limit the sale of their personal information to third parties.</p>
                <p><strong>e. Right to Data Portability for Specific Data: </strong>Consumers have the right to request
                    their personal information in a readily usable format, allowing them to move their data to other
                    services.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="business">
                <h3>Business Obligations:</h3>
                <p>The CPRA imposes new obligations on businesses that process personal information. These include:</p>
                <p><strong>a. Contractual Obligations with Service Providers: </strong>Businesses must now enter into
                    written agreements with their service providers to ensure that the service providers process
                    personal information in compliance with CPRA requirements.</p>
                <p><strong>b. Data Retention Limits: </strong>The CPRA introduces specific requirements for data
                    retention, requiring businesses to retain personal information only for the period necessary for the
                    purposes for which it was collected. </p>
                <p><strong>c. Data Minimization: </strong>Businesses must limit the collection, use, retention, and
                    sharing of personal information to what is reasonably necessary for the purposes disclosed to
                    consumers.</p>
                <p><strong>d. Third-party Sharing Restrictions: </strong>Businesses are required to include contractual
                    provisions with third parties to whom they sell or share personal information, specifying that the
                    information can only be used for the purpose for which it was shared and cannot be sold further
                    without explicit consent.</p>
                <p><strong>e. Sensitive Personal Information Consent: </strong>The CPRA requires businesses to obtain
                    consumers' explicit consent to process sensitive personal information, providing a higher level of
                    protection for this category of data.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="cppa">
                <h3>Creation of California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA):</h3>
                <p>The CPRA establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency, an independent entity responsible for
                    enforcing and implementing the CPRA. The CPPA takes over the enforcement responsibilities from the
                    California Attorney General, which was responsible for enforcing the CCPA.</p>
                <h3>Increased Penalties for Non-compliance:</h3>
                <p>The CPRA increases the maximum penalties for violations concerning consumers' personal information,
                    imposing fines of up to $7,500 per intentional violation and $2,500 per unintentional violation. The
                    penalties are higher for violations involving minors' personal information.</p>
                <h3>Annual Risk Assessment and Audits:</h3>
                <p>The CPRA requires businesses that process large amounts of personal information or engage in
                    activities that present a high risk to consumers' privacy to conduct regular cybersecurity audits
                    and risk assessments.</p>
                <h3>Impact Assessments for Profiling and Automated Decision-making:</h3>
                <p>The CPRA introduces requirements for businesses that engage in profiling and automated decision-
                    making that significantly affects individuals. Businesses must conduct and document impact
                    assessments to evaluate the potential risks and harms to consumers' rights and freedoms.</p>
                <h3>Expansion of CCPA to Employee Data:</h3>
                <p>The CPRA expands the scope of the CCPA to include employee data, providing employees with more
                    privacy protections regarding their personal information collected and processed by their employers.
                </p>
                <h3>Data Protection for Children:</h3>
                <p>The CPRA introduces additional protections for the personal information of children, requiring
                    businesses to obtain opt-in consent from parents or guardians for the sale of personal information
                    of children under the age of 13.</p>
                <h3>Private Right of Action for Data Breaches:</h3>
                <p>The CPRA allows consumers to pursue legal action against businesses if their personal information is
                    subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure as a result of a business's
                    failure to implement reasonable security measures.</p>
                <h3>Limited Exemption for Employee Information:</h3>
                <p>While the CPRA extends privacy rights to employee data, it provides a limited exemption for certain
                    personal information collected for employment-related purposes, such as human resources data.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="conclude">
                <p>In conclusion, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) is a significant update to the California
                    Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), enhancing consumer privacy rights and introducing new obligations for
                    businesses that process personal information of California residents. With the establishment of the
                    California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA), enforcement of the CPRA is expected to be more focused
                    and streamlined. Businesses operating in California must ensure they are compliant with the CPRA's
                    requirements to protect consumer privacy, avoid potential penalties for non-compliance, and maintain
                    consumer trust in an increasingly privacy-conscious era.</p>
